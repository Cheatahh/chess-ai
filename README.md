# chess-ai [WIP!]

As simple as that. :) This project is part of a student work for my uni.

Please make sure to install the IJulia, Chess, NBInclude & Benchmark extensions for Julia.

This project is part of a student group project for my university. 

The idea is to use Julia and Chess.jl to create a working Chess-AI. The final examination is a match against the known "Stockfish" Chess-AI.

The following algorithm are being used:
 - [Simple Evaluation](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Simplified_Evaluation_Function)
 - [MiniMax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax)
